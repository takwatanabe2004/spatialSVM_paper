In this work, we introduced a regularized ERM framework that explicitly accounts for the $6$-D spatial structure in the connectome via the fused Lasso and the GraphNet regularizer. 
We demonstrate that our method recovers sparse and highly interpretable patterns across the connectome while maintaining predictive power, and thus could generate new insights into how psychiatric disorders impact brain networks.
